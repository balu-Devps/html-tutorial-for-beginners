**HTML**
Hyper Text Markup Language, here markup means marking a word bold or italic or underline or make paragraph by markups like <b></b> <i></i> <p></p>,PS, HTML is the product of printing technology. So that’s where the word markup came from. In general HTML helps to structures the data or holder of the data.  So if user wants to see their data structured then they should format their data according to html tags/elements.

**CSS**
Cascading Style Sheets, it’s the styling language used to do designing/presentation/formatting of structured data aka HTML tags/elements. In simple words, via CSS we can say what is the color of font/ size, how and where to position the images, what type of fonts, size of the grid/table etc. User must follow the rules of CSS styling language.

**JavaScript**
Plays behavioral role or it interacts with the user, for ex: Alerting users through message boxes, or when user clicks on submit button, JavaScript validates user has entered all the required/mandatory field before submitting data to sever, etc. Through JS user can request data from server for ex: their checking account balances or transaction data.

Each of the above components are worth of a book or more. But in general it is simple, Structure + Present + Behavior combined all these three makes the web working and helps human to improve their standard of living or simply.
